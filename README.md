# Climbing-Game
My climbing game one level demo for mobile device.

I removed  Library files, all files is only 90mb.When you are open with Unity Hub.Please put the SampleScene on the Hierarchy panel and dont forget to delete default Scene.
I designed for mobile device this game for my task.Also ı tryed lots of phoned for issue but in my experiance every phone can work my games.
I used Simulator package from Unity package for testing. I designed for mobile device so , ı used only touch code at c#.
It is completely ready for use with  sounds and effects. 
I used ragdoll character, and that can be optional.I used character idle and jump animation.
I used public Game Object lots of code and İf Game Designer want to change something in the game , that can be do easly.
